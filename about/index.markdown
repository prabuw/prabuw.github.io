My name is <span class="intro"><strong class="author-name" itemprop="name">Prabu Weerasinghe</strong><span>. I am a developer from Sydney, Australia currently based in London, UK.

I currently work with with C#, .NET, Angular 1 and TypeScript.

I keep this blog mostly as a reference/reminder of things I came across in software development. I occasionally will blog about other topics, such as my hobbies.
