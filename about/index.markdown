Hi, my name is Prabu Weerasinghe. I'm a Sri Lankan that left my homeland very young and grew up predominantly in
Singapore and Australia. I currently reside in ~~Sydney, Australia~~ London, England.

I'm developer primarily working with .NET technologies, plying my trade as a developer. C# is my language of choice.
Apart from C#, I have an avid interest with Javascript.

When I'm not doing work, I have a slight obsession with football, either playing or watching it. I am a
[gooner](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=gooner "gooner"). **Come on you Gunners**. My crowning moment
as football fanatic has been attending a world cup final.

I also have an interest in the diving and ~~also~~ use to keep a reef tank. Whenever, I get the opportunity I also travel to see
the rest of this planet.

I keep this blog mostly as a reference/reminder of things I came across in software development. I occasionally will
blog about other topics, such as my hobbies.
