Hi, my name is Prabu Weerasinghe. I'm a Sri Lankan that left my homeland very young and grew up predominantly in
Singapore and Australia. I currently reside in Sydney, Australia.

I'm developer primarily working with .NET technologies, where C# is my language of choice. Apart from C#, I have an
interest with Javascript.

When I'm not doing work, I have a slight obsession with football, either playing or watching it. I am a gooner and
support The Arsenal. **Come on you Gunners**. My crowning moment as football fanatic has been attending a world cup
final (Spain vs Netherlands 2010).

I also have an interest in the diving and also keep a reef tank. Whenever, I get the opportunity I also travel to see
the rest of this planet.
