<p align="justify">A mate and I decided last year to do a live-a-board dive trip. We settled on doing the <a href="http://www.prodivecairns.com/3dayouterreef.html">3 day/2 night outer reef live-a-board</a> offered by Prodive Cairns. It was a brilliant holiday, below is the play by play.</p>
<p align="justify">We flew up late on a Friday in December (21st), with the live-a-board booked for the next day. Once we landed and got a taxi out to the hotel (20 minutes), it was already 10pm. We stayed in a hotel on Sheridan St in Cairns. We settled in, grabbed&nbsp; a quick beer and crashed out for the early start.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Quick note:</strong> In hindsight, I would have preferred to stay closer to the centre of town. Basically all the nightlife is on the <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=-16.919846,145.777156&amp;num=1&amp;vpsrc=6&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=-16.92042,145.778167&amp;spn=0.020016,0.033023&amp;t=m&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=A&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=-16.919916,145.777283&amp;panoid=YdM7iF5rslxHsR3JjhBkZw&amp;cbp=12,302.27,,0,0.07">Esplanade</a>, which is a street going along the waterfront. Not that it mattered that first night, because all we wanted was a bed to sleep on till the next day.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong><u>Day 1</u></strong></p>
<p align="justify">6:30am and we had slept in. The transfer had come and gone. We called them, and they came back to get us. Lucky! A word to the wise, they do the transfer but not do the wake up call, so get ready and be outside. Once back at the Prodive shop, we got fitted for our gear, and waited for the staff to take us to the boat.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Hindsight:</strong> Liquor shops do not open between 7am to 8am. If you want some booze for the trip, get it the night before. We never had a chance to get some, since by the time we got to cairns it was already 9pm and the shops were closed.</p>
<p align="justify">Once on the boat, we had a briefing and met all the wonderful crew. We were assigned out rooms, and let me just say, it is quite cosy in there, but more than adequate for a good night's sleep. If you are prone to sea sickness (like I am), then make sure to take the sea sickness tablets. They offer you some at $2 for 2 pills.&nbsp; I was not taking any chances and took 3 different types (Kwells, TravelCalm and Ondansetron). The last one, Ondansetron, requires a prescription which you can get from your local GP. One of them worked! A very nice breakfast was served on the way out.</p>
<p align="justify">The boat ride out there was not too choppy, and took about 90 minutes. 10:30am, and we are gearing up for the first dive. Apart from this dive and the two night dives offered, all other dives <span style="text-decoration:underline;">are not</span> guided! Since both my friend and I are not experienced divers (me: 12 dives and him: 4 dives), we were nervous at the thought.&nbsp; We did the first one guided, mostly since the last time I dived was 2 years ago. It was spectacular. The water was balmy 28 degrees. I wish I had a camera for the whole trip, but only got one for two dives on the second day. All the photos in this post are from those two dives.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Advice:</strong> Bring an underwater camera. If you don't have one, you can hire one on the boat, but it's expensive at $38 per dive. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">There are only 5 cameras available to hire on the boat</span>. There are shops in Cairns, that allow you to hire a camera at a flat rate per day. Once again, we didn't know or have a chance to do that. My suggestion: Buy a <a href="http://gopro.com/">GoPro</a>. Some of the people on the boat had them, and I saw their footage. Quality memories.</p>
<p align="justify">After the first dive, the cook presented us with a delicious lunch with a large variety. Diving makes you tired and hungry! It was at this point my friend and I decided to sign up and do PADI's Advanced Open Water course for an extra $155.</p>
<p align="justify">The course involves 5 required dives which will be done with one of the crew (who is a certified dive instructor) and the usual coursework as well. The 5 dives we did were:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<div align="justify">Peak performance buoyancy (Elective)</div>
<li>
<div align="justify">Compass navigation</div>
<li>
<div align="justify">Night diving</div>
<li>
<div align="justify">Deep dive</div>
<li>
<div align="justify">Underwater naturalist (Elective)</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p align="justify">After a big lunch and break, we were up for the second dive of the day (2:30pm). While we ate, the crew moved to the next dive site. Cue the peak performance buoyancy dive, which was all about getting your buoyancy perfect. There was a couple of fun games to be played to <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">master</span> learn the skill, such as navigating through hoops, hovering on the spot etc. It's all about using your breathing to elevate/lower yourself. Once the course component was done, the dive instructor took us on a tour of the dive site, which generally meant you saw all the good stuff.&nbsp; You also got to use the new mastered skill to rise over an oncoming reef as you were swimming along.</p>
<p align="justify"><a href="http://pwee167.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_4751.jpg"><img title="IMG_4751" style="background-image:none;padding-top:0;padding-left:0;display:inline;padding-right:0;border-width:0;" border="0" alt="IMG_4751" src="http://pwee167.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_4751_thumb.jpg" width="640" height="486"></a></p>
<p align="justify">A short surface interval, and we were back in the water for the next course dive (4:30pm): Compass navigation. The sun was beaming down strongly even at this point in the afternoon, and the water was still a very warm 28 degrees and calm. As the name of the dive suggests, it was about navigation under water, mainly using a compass as well as other techniques. This is a very handy skill to have, especially for doing the unguided dives, as they draw a map on the whiteboard and brief the divers possible routes to follow using headings at major points in the dive.</p>
<p align="justify">Back on deck, and a scrumptious dinner was served, which some of us ate out on the upper deck where a warm summer breeze was blowing. Just enough energy to get us through to the last dive of the day: the night dive (my first ever!). Up until this point, we have seen lots of corals, clams, colourful fish (e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomacanthidae">Angels</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrasse">Wrasses</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parrotfish">Parrot fish</a>) but not any sharks. I have dived with sharks before, but the thought of diving into a black ocean with them was slightly unsettling. A quick run through of the dive with the dive instructor, and before I knew it, I was in there with a torch. What I quickly realised was the dive boat's floodlights are very easy to see even from the ocean floor. That eased the nerves a bit.</p>
<p align="justify">Hand signals slightly change during a night dive (one which included flipping the bird for when your air reached 50 bar). Our instructor and the students used these to communicate to complete the course component. After that, we just had a guided tour of the dive site. It's amazing to see what creatures are out night, most noticeably the sharks. Before ascending back to the boat, there was a moment where we sat on the ocean floor under the boat below a school of small fish, and watched two <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_reef_shark">grey reef sharks</a> circle them for a few minutes. They are magnificent animals but are nothing short of (deadly) missiles in the water. Our instructor said, they were around 2.5 meters long.</p>
<p align="justify"><a href="http://pwee167.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_4715.jpg"><img title="IMG_4715" style="background-image:none;padding-top:0;padding-left:0;display:inline;padding-right:0;border-width:0;" border="0" alt="IMG_4715" src="http://pwee167.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_4715_thumb.jpg" width="640" height="487"></a></p>
<p align="justify">After the dive, a tasty dessert was served and I chatted with some other passengers about what they saw that day, but soon went to bed for a good night's rest. A perfect first day on the live-a-board.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong><u>Day 2</u></strong></p>
<p align="justify">The second day began with an early wake up call of 6am and a new dive site. A healthy breakfast was served to get a good start to the day, followed by the briefing for the first dive of the day. It was a fun dive for us doing the course, and it was our first chance at diving without a guide. The water was calm and a warm 28 degrees, while the weather up top was nice and sunny.&nbsp; 7:30am and we were in the drink descending.</p>
<p align="justify">Having no guide meant we were free to roam around (with a map of the site from the briefing fresh in our mind). The freedom is quite invigorating, bringing a new level of enjoyment to discovering the little wonders down there.</p>
<p align="justify">A decent break at the surface and some food, followed by another fun dive (11:00am). By this point, my mate and I were diving with few others (in pairs of course â€“ buddy up!). This dive was quite awesome, and the picture of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitetip_reef_shark">white tip reef shark</a> above was from it. I saw this shark type the most on the trip during the day, usually just chilling on the sandy bottoms of the ocean.&nbsp; A nice 45 minute dive and we were back on the boat for lunch, as the crew pulled anchor and moved onto the final location for the day.</p>
<p align="justify">The third dive of the day was a course dive: Underwater Naturalist. This is an elective dive, and while we wanted to do the underwater photography, there were no camera's to hire. It made sense when the dive supervisor on the boat said this is the best dive site out of all on the trip, and it did not disappoint. We saw massive clams, turtles eating, sting rays feeding, thousands of colourful fish, mountains of corals, but the big finale was a gigantic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manta_Ray">manta ray</a>. While I only saw a glimpse, a group of fellow divers swam with it and have the footage from their GoPro camera. I could dive this place over and over again. The dive site is called<strong> </strong>"<em>Flynn â€“ Gordon's"</em>. Dinner is served.</p>
<p align="justify"><a href="http://pwee167.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_4807.jpg"><img title="IMG_4807" style="background-image:none;padding-top:0;padding-left:0;display:inline;padding-right:0;border-width:0;" border="0" alt="IMG_4807" src="http://pwee167.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_4807_thumb.jpg" width="640" height="487"></a></p>
<p align="justify">The last dive of the day (eighth dive in two days), and I must admit, my mate and I were a bit exhausted. We were not going to dive with a bit of wind and rain coming on, but was encouraged by the crew, and once again was a good move in hindsight. The final dive was a guided night dive of <em>"Flynn â€“ Gordon's"</em>. I will always remember this dive for two things: a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loggerhead_sea_turtle">loggerhead sea turtle</a> swimming right over my head and a shark swimming past my mate's leg as he was about to get back on to the boat! Half past eight, and we were dry and on the boat having dessert, custard pie with cream if I recall. Another spectacular day on the reef!</p>
<p align="justify"><strong><u>Day 3</u></strong></p>
<p align="justify">Last day on the dive trip, and the dive supervisor woke us up early for the first dive of the day (6:30am). For us it was the final course dive: the deep dive. Down we went to a depth of 28 meters. We played some fun maths games to understand the effects of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_narcosis">narcosis</a>. A short dive of 33 minutes and we were up on deck eating breakfast.</p>
<p align="justify">A very short surface interval and we were back in the water for the second dive (8:50am). This was a fun dive, and we just explored the site with freedom. We saw two <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphiprioninae">clownfish</a> hosting a large green anemone , a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trumpetfish">yellow trumpet fish</a> and a pair of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuttlefish">cuttlefish</a> hovering between coral heads.</p>
<p align="justify"><a href="http://pwee167.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_4794.jpg"><img title="IMG_4794" style="background-image:none;padding-top:0;padding-left:0;display:inline;padding-right:0;border-width:0;" border="0" alt="IMG_4794" src="http://pwee167.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_4794_thumb.jpg" width="640" height="485"></a></p>
<p align="justify">Another short break with sandwiches and we were gearing up for our final dive of the trip. We jumped in at 10:30am and stayed under for 50 minutes. We relaxed and explored the maze of coral heads at the same dive site. Before we knew it, we were on board and cruising back to Cairns.</p>
<p align="justify">11 dives in 3 days and an Advance Open Water certification later, and we were back on land. We arrived back at our hotel around 5pm. The crew met the passengers for dinner and (mostly) drinks at the <a href="https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CF8QFjAC&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cocknbull.net.au%2F&amp;ei=nUXmUNL0K-yhmQXx44EY&amp;usg=AFQjCNFZ4gzphSrldZsUaFGfaLtFxvUzvA&amp;sig2=471wpTo9ATyUqkBkRrkEDA&amp;bvm=bv.1355534169,d.dGY">Cock &amp; Bull</a> to top the trip off. A few of us kicked on with some of the younger crew till late into the night, which remains a bit of blur.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Warning:</strong> After three days on the water, the swaying of the boat remains once on land and can cause land sickness. I found having a few drinks resolved the issue, but only temporarily. It took me another day to fully recover from it.</p>
<p align="justify">We stayed another day in Cairns, since<strong> it is advised to wait 24 hours since your last dive before flying</strong>. It just happened to be Christmas day, and everything was closed. We moseyed around to the Esplanade for some food and relaxed for the day on the grassy areas next to the public lagoon. Most of Cairns seemed to be there, trying to escape the 30+ degree heat. We flew out boxing day.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Summary:</span></strong></p>
<p align="justify">This was my first live-a-board, and I must admit it was a spectacular experience with a superb crew and great weather. They really did make the trip that much better, from the variety of food (I think we had at least 3 different types of cakes!), to the professionalism and safety in managing the dives and equipment to their relaxed and friendly personalities. They catered for everything: there is even free WIFI in the common area of the boat!</p>
<p align="justify">11 dives in 3 days can be tiring and a lot of people chose to skip a dive here or there to relax on the boat or go for a snorkel, after all it is meant to be a holiday. However, for me nothing compares to the feeling of being under water.</p>
<p align="justify">The weather gods also blessed us, the roughest the seas got was probably a bit of rocking while everyone slept on the first night. Finally, the great barrier reef, it has to be one the great wonders of the under water world. Will definitely be diving up here again with Prodive!</p>
